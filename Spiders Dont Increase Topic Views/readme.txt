[color=#00BB00][b][size=12pt]Features[/size][/b][/color]
[img]http://dev.smfchat.com/img/add.png[/img] Does not increase topic views for spiders.

When spiders are browsing your forum, they will increase the topic views in every topic they visit.  This modification basically detects most well-known spiders , and if so, it won't increase page count.

This will give you a better idea of actually how many REAL people are viewing topics.
It will also save on a few queries.

[color=#00BB00][b][size=12pt]Installation[/size][/b][/color]
Any previous versions of this mod [b]MUST [/b]be uninstalled [b]BEFORE [/b]installing this version.

Simply install the package to install on the SMF Default Core Theme [b]ONLY[/b].

If your theme has its own versions of the language files Modifications.english.php and/or Modifications.english-utf8.php, OR if your using a language other than those supported (listed above) by the mod then you will need to copy the language strings into each custom version of those files.
