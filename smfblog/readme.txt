[color=blue][b][size=12pt]Introduction[/size][/b][/color]
It has been requested heaps, and now is finally available! SMFBlog is an extremely simple blogging system for SMF. Certain boards can be marked as "blog boards", and these boards will all be listed on the main blog page. Blog posts are topics in these boards, and comments are replies to these posts.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt]Installation[/size][/b][/color]
Simply install this package, and SMFBlog will be installed.
In order to use the pretty URLs, you'll need to rename htaccess.txt to .htaccess (yes, that's a dot as the first character). If you already have a .htaccess file, copy the entire contents of the htaccess.txt file to the end of it.


[color=blue][b][size=12pt]How do I use this mod?[/size][/b][/color]
Using this mod is extremely simple!
Firstly, specify one (or more) boards to be blog boards. This is done by editing the board, and ticking the "Use board as blog board?" option. You may add some new boards for this purpose :)
