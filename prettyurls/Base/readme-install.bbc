[b][url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=636]Pretty URLs[/url][/b] is a URL management package for Simple Machine Forums (SMF).

It is simple, powerful, extensible and free. Most of all, it is pretty! Its main purpose is to rewrite the important SMF URLs, like these:
[list]
[li][nobbc]http://domain.com/board/topic/[/nobbc][/li]
[li][nobbc]http://domain.com/profile/user/[/nobbc][/li]
[li][nobbc]http://domain.com/unreadreplies/[/nobbc][/li]
[/list]
Pretty URLs will work with SMF 1.1 and 2.0. It requires an Apache webserver with support for mod_rewrite and .htaccess files.
